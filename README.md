# MacroPad
Generic Keyboard MacroPad Prototype. This macro pad is a 4x3 matrix based on the ATMEGA32U4. It should be fairly easy to take this design and scale it up or down depending on the use case.

This was made following these two ressources:
- [ai03 Custom Keyboard](https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design)
- [Masterzen's Blog](https://www.masterzen.fr/2020/05/03/designing-a-keyboard-part-1/)

Future revisions of this board will potentially include:
- LEDs
- Different key matrices
  - 2x1 for OSU
  - Numpad
  - TKL
  - Split keyboard layout (see ZSA Moonlander)
  - Alice Layout
- Customized software for macro programming
- Redesigned enclosure
